# life-cycle-in-React

A simple repo about life cycle methods of a component in React.

1.The componentDidMount() method

It is called once in the component life cycle and it signals that the component and all its sub-components have rendered properly. This is the best place to make API calls since, at this point, the component has been mounted and is available to the DOM.
